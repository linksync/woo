WooCommerce extension for syncing inventory and order data with Vend.

== Description ==
linksync for WooCommerce and Vend is a plugin that works in the backend to automatically sync products and orders between your Wordpress WooCommerce online store and Vend with REAL-TIME UPDATES.

**Product Syncing**
Add a new product, create new variants or make changes to an existing product in your online store, and see the change in the Vend moments later. Or make changes in Vend and have them sync to WooCommerce. The product syncing capabilities are very flexible so that they can be tailored to your business needs.

**Order Syncing**
linksync works so whenever you have a sales order created in Wordpress WooCommerce, it will automatically sync to Vend to updating your contacts and inventory in the process.


== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* WooCommerce 2.6.10 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of linksync for WooCommerce and Vend, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “linksync for WooCommerce and Vend” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).



== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What are the minimum plugin and software requirements for link sync for WooCommerce? =
* WooCommerce 2.2.0 or greater
* PHP 5.2.4 or greater
* curl support must be enabled on your server (usually enabled by default with most hosting companies).

= How often is data synced between Vend and my WooCommerce store? =
Product changes and orders are synced immediately, so within moments a change in one store should be reflected in the other, depending on what syncing options you have in place.

= Can images be synced between Vend and WooCommerce? =
Yes and no. We can sync images from Vend to WooCommerce, so if you have product image in Vend then we can sync them to products in WooCommerce, but Vend does not support images uploading at this time, so we are not able to sync or push images from WooCommerce to Vend.

= Do you support the latest version for WooCommerce and Vend? =
Yes, we support the latest version on both apps.

No, you don’t. linksync automatically syncs your orders and products.
